  <p align="center">
    Starlight Space Journeys was a website project that originated from a school assignment. 
    The assignment's goal was to create a fully responsive website 
    tailored for a client requesting a space themed eCommerce store. In addition, the project showcases a 
    series of cleverly integrated JavaScript scripts, enabling captivating features such as 
    interactive button events and dynamic testimonial slideshows, among others.
